This mod is for more advanced users with access to Fusion360 and requires parameters set for your specific needs: 

Hinge angle, door thickness, foam thickness (if used), foam compression and use of a 3ID4OD ptfe tube as hinge material (or not). 

To edit the parameters, follow the 2nd image.

To save as STL, follow the 3rd image. 

For a perfect touch of the door panels, print the hinge frame and hinge door pieces and install them to your frame, then dry fit the panels against the hinges and measure the gap between them in the middle.  Change the parameter for DoorPanelGap and it'll divide by two so each panel is offset enough to touch in the middle. If your panels are too wide to close, unfortunately you'll need to trim them down a little where the hinge part aligns with the door.  A flat file will remove 0.5mm if needed fairly easily.
