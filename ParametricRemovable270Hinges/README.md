Thanks to Chris Gonzales for inspiration from his 270 degree parametric hinge design. You can use his door handles with my hinges. I also matched his door hole locations so if you've already drilled your panels for his hinges you can change to mine.

This mod is for more advanced users with access to Fusion360 and requires parameters set for your specific needs: 

Hinge angle, door thickness, foam thickness (if used), foam compression and use of a 3ID4OD ptfe tube as hinge material (or not). 

To edit the parameters, select Modify then Change Parameters (image 3)

To save as STL, double click the part, then right click, then Save as Mesh (image 4) 

Print orientation: The hinge door and hinge frame should be printed face down so the print texture matches. The drill guide should be printed with the flat side with no holes facing down.  

For a perfect touch of the door panels, print the hinge frame and hinge door pieces and install them to your frame, then dry fit the panels against the hinges and measure the gap between them in the middle.  Change the parameter for DoorPanelGap and it'll divide by two so each panel is offset enough to touch in the middle. If your panels are too wide to close, unfortunately you'll need to trim them down a little where the hinge part aligns with the door.  A flat file will remove 0.5mm if needed fairly easily.

BOM (per hinge)

1 - 3mm or 1/8" drill bit for drilling the panels. 

1 - M3-30 or M3-35 socket head screw (if you use a M3-35 you'll need to back it out from fully inserted about 1mm)

2 - m3 5x4x3mm heat set insert (voron standard)

2 - M3-10mm or 12mm (depending on panel thickness).  Can use flat head if you have them or flip the back plates over and use pan or socket heads.
